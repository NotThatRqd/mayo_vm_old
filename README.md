Mayo VM is a (kinda) joke virtual machine written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
It's 16-bit and based off [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP29wDx6QmW5DdwpdwHCRJsEubS5NrQ9b) amazing Youtube series.
If you want to contribute just make a pull request with your changes and I'll probably take a look sometime.
